### 13th Feb 

##### Key points discussed - Brief discussion on project ideas

	- Project idea 1

 	 **Art work recommendation system**
  
   	 - Based on personal preference
    
  	  - Recommendation based on art work metadata and annotated data
    
   	 - Interactive system
    
  	  - Collaborative filtering 
    
	- Project idea 2

	  **Amsterdam living area recommendation for family with children**

	    - Query response app
    
  	  - Recommended area light up according to user preference. (e.g. park and public transportation)
    
   	 - Need cool design features
    
	- Project idea 3

	  **Art analysis assistant - theme linked to objects changing over time**
  
	  - Annotations might be useful: genre, style, century. Concepts and objects
  
  	[reference: how to analyze an artwork](https://www.studentartguide.com/articles/how-to-analyze-an-artwork)
  
 ##### Issue 
 
 	 - Identify differences of information visualization and Information analytics 
 
 ##### Working plan
 
  	- By 18th Feb., build sketch of each project ideas.
 	 - Determine key features needs to be visualized.
